# Official Implementation of SeqHand
This is implementation of synthetic hand motion generation presented in [SeqHAND (ECCV 2020)](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123570120.pdf).

I have normalized BigHand annotations (3D joint coordinates for each pose data) and re-ordered them in MANO order.
You need to get this [normalized BigHand file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13iiZDkxA3hCR6l4L4Em2Dxo6jBTvkBLM/view?usp=sharing) in order to generate hand motions.
